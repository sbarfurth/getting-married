## Prerequisites

You will need to have Golang installed. The development container in this
repository has this set up already.

Install the required binaries using `go install`.

```console
go install github.com/bufbuild/buf/cmd/buf@latest
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install connectrpc.com/connect/cmd/protoc-gen-connect-go@latest
```
